# Step-by-step Breakdown
---

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of `Movie Recommendation System` project in an organized manner without including the actual code:

## Step 1: Importing Dependencies

In this step, import the required libraries and modules necessary for various project functionalities. These libraries include `numpy`, `pandas`, `regular expression (re)`, `web scraping (requests and BeautifulSoup)`, `IPython utilities`, `ast`, and modules from `sklearn` for `text processing` and `similarity calculation`.

## Step 2: Reading Files

Here, read the relevant CSV files using the `pandas` library. These files contain movie-related data such as credits, keywords, links, and metadata.

## Step 3: Preprocessing

### Basic Preprocessing

1. **Convert 'id' to numeric:** Convert the 'id' column of the movies metadata to numeric type and handle missing values.

2. **Merge Dataframes:** Merge the movies metadata and credits dataframes based on the 'id' column.

### Applying Special Case

1. **Explore Movie Criteria:** You explore revenue, vote average, and vote count to identify meaningful movies for analysis.

2. **Filter Movies:** Filter out movies with non-zero vote counts, vote averages, and specific runtime criteria.

### Selecting Relevant Columns

Select a subset of relevant columns from the merged dataframe, including 'genres', 'id', 'imdb_id', 'overview', 'poster_path', 'title', 'cast', and 'crew'.

### Filling Null Values

#### IMDb ID

1. **Handling Missing IMDb IDs:** Handle missing IMDb IDs using an API, obtaining IMDb IDs for movies without them.

#### Overview

1. **Fetching Missing Overviews:** Fetch missing movie overviews from an API to complete the dataset.

#### Poster Path

1. **Retrieving Missing Poster Paths:** Retrieve missing poster paths using an API to enhance the dataset.

### Cleaning Columns

1. **Filtering Empty Fields:** Filter out movies with empty 'genres', 'cast', and 'crew' fields to improve data quality.

### Processing Cast and Crew

1. **Extracting Cast Names:** Extract cast member names from the 'cast' column.

2. **Director Information:** Identify and extract the director's name from the 'crew' column.

### Combining Features

1. **Creating an 'all' Column:** Create a new column named 'all', which combines various features like 'genres', 'cast', 'director', and 'overview' into a single string.

## Step 4: Applying ML Algorithm - Cosine Similarity

### Preparing Text Data

1. **Lowercasing Text:** Convert the text data in the 'all' column to lowercase for consistency.

2. **Removing HTML Tags:** Eliminate HTML tags from the text in the 'all' column using regular expressions.

3. **Removing URLs:** Remove URLs from the text data in the 'all' column.

4. **Removing Punctuations:** Remove punctuation marks from the text data.

5. **Removing Stopwords:** Remove stopwords from the text using the NLTK library.

### Calculating Cosine Similarity

1. **Transforming Data:** Transform the preprocessed text data into a matrix using CountVectorizer.

2. **Cosine Similarity:** Calculate cosine similarity scores between movies based on the transformed data.

## Step 5: Building Recommendations

### Defining Recommendation Function

1. **Creating Function:** Define a function called `get_recommendations` that takes a movie title as input and returns recommended movie IDs based on cosine similarity scores.

### Applying Recommendation Function

1. **Generating Recommendations:** Apply the `get_recommendations` function to each movie title to generate a list of recommended movie IDs.

## Step 6: Saving Data

1. **Storing Results:** Save the processed data, including recommended movie IDs, to a CSV file for future use and analysis.

This organized breakdown outlines each step of your Movie Recommendation System project and summarizes the key actions taken in a structured manner.
