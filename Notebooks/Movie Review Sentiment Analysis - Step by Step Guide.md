# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis Model : Step by Step Guide
---
Certainly! Here's a detailed step-by-step guide of the Movie Review Sentiment Analysis model without including the actual code:

## Loading Libraries
- Import necessary libraries and modules for data preprocessing and machine learning.

## Importing Dataset
- Load the IMDb movie review dataset using pandas.
- Display the shape and a preview of the dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Perform basic exploratory data analysis on the dataset.
- Generate summary statistics and count sentiment labels (positive/negative).

## Splitting Training and Testing Data
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for reviews and sentiments.
- Create separate sets for training and testing data.

## Text Normalization
- Tokenize the text using the ToktokTokenizer from NLTK.
- Remove HTML tags and noise from reviews using BeautifulSoup and regular expressions.
- Remove special characters using regular expressions.
- Perform stemming to reduce words to their root form using the Porter stemmer.
- Remove stop words using NLTK's stop words list.

## Normalized Train and Test Datasets
- Create normalized versions of the training and testing review datasets, along with sentiment labels.

## Text to Vector Transformation
### Bag of Words (BoW) Model
- Use the CountVectorizer from sklearn to create a BoW model.
- Fit the BoW model on the normalized training review data and transform both training and testing data.

### Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) Model
- Use the TfidfVectorizer from sklearn to create a TF-IDF model.
- Fit the TF-IDF model on the normalized training review data and transform both training and testing data.

## Labeling Sentiment Texts
- Use LabelBinarizer to convert sentiment labels into binary format (0 for negative, 1 for positive).

## Logistic Regression
- Choose Logistic Regression as the classification algorithm.
- Fit the Logistic Regression model on both the Bag of Words and TF-IDF transformed training review data.
- Predict sentiment labels for the testing data using both BoW and TF-IDF models.

## Classification Report
- Generate a classification report for both BoW and TF-IDF models.
- Include metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score for each sentiment class.

## Confusion Matrix
- Create a confusion matrix for both BoW and TF-IDF models.
- Display the number of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions for each sentiment class.

## Choosing the Best Model
- Compare the accuracy scores of both BoW and TF-IDF models.
- Conclude that the Logistic Regression model with Bag of Words (BoW) representation provides the best accuracy for sentiment analysis.

In summary, this analysis involves data preprocessing, feature extraction using Bag of Words and TF-IDF, training and evaluating different classification models, and selecting the best-performing model for sentiment analysis of movie reviews.
